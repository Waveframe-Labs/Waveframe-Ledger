# Governance Chronology Replay

Governance chronology replay reconstructs governance meaning from append-only governance events.

It is not runtime execution replay. It is not Guard admissibility replay. It is not Cloud operational replay.

Given the same event stream and the same replay cutoff, Ledger must produce the same `governance_replay_state.v1`.

## Core Rules

Governance chronology replay is:

- deterministic
- chronological
- derived from append-only input events
- cutoff-bounded
- non-mutating
- Ledger-owned semantic reconstruction

Governance chronology replay must not:

- call Guard
- call Cloud
- mutate source events
- evaluate execution admissibility
- generate AI recommendations
- probabilistically score risk

## Input

Input is an ordered or unordered list of append-only governance events.

Supported initial event types:

- `authority_lifecycle_event.v1`
- `governance_event.v1`
- `projection_generation_event.v1`
- `projection_invalidation_event.v1`
- `continuity_transition_event.v1`

The implementation must sort events chronologically before applying them.

## Replay Cutoff

`replay_cutoff` determines the replayed state.

Only events with `timestamp <= replay_cutoff` are included. Events after the cutoff are ignored.

If `replay_cutoff` is omitted, all events are included and the replay cutoff is the latest included event timestamp.

Rule:

```text
same event stream + same cutoff = same replay state
```

## Output

Replay emits:

- `governance_replay_state.v1`

The replay state reconstructs:

- active authorities
- lineage state
- continuity state
- replay posture
- projection freshness
- governance health
- operational summaries

## Active Authority Semantics

An authority becomes active when a `registered` lifecycle event is applied.

An authority is no longer active when:

- it is superseded
- it is revoked

Multiple active authorities in one authority family emit an authority conflict in governance health.

## Lineage Semantics

Lineage state is reconstructed from authority lifecycle events and governance events.

Initial lineage reconstruction records:

- authority reference
- authority version
- latest lifecycle status
- lifecycle event IDs
- superseded by
- revoked posture

## Projection Freshness Semantics

Projection generation sets projection freshness to `fresh`.

Projection invalidation sets projection freshness to `invalidated`.

Projection freshness is keyed by:

```text
authority_ref + projection_name
```

## Continuity Semantics

Continuity transition events update continuity posture.

Initial continuity replay records:

- authority reference
- current continuity posture
- transition type
- source event ID

## Replay Posture Semantics

Replay posture is reconstructed from lifecycle evidence and projection events.

Initial replay posture records whether receipt evidence appears in lifecycle artifact hashes or replay-related event details.

## Governance Health Semantics

Governance health is deterministic and advisory.

Initial health signals include:

- `healthy`
- `authority_conflict`
- `replay_degraded`
- `continuity_risk`

Governance health does not block publication and does not evaluate admissibility.

## Operational Summary Semantics

Operational summaries are reconstructed from replayed authority state.

Initial summaries are intentionally compact:

- authority reference
- authority version
- lifecycle status
- active state
- continuity posture
- replay posture

Future implementations may hydrate summaries from stored semantic artifacts or projection generation events, but replay must remain deterministic.

## Non-Goals

Governance chronology replay does not:

- execute workflows
- replay runtime evidence packages
- approve authorities
- register authorities
- supersede authorities
- revoke authorities
- call external systems

It reconstructs governance meaning from history alone.
