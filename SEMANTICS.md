# Semantic Governance Artifacts

Governance-Ledger owns deterministic governance meaning for structured authority artifacts.

The semantic layer lives under `governance_ledger/semantics/`. It derives canonical artifacts from authority contracts and publication evidence. It does not invoke Guard, Cloud services, replay execution, simulation, or admissibility evaluation.

## Boundary

Ledger owns governance meaning:

- deterministic governance interpretation
- operational consequence derivation
- lifecycle and continuity implications
- semantic lineage artifacts
- publishable authority bundles

Cloud owns governance operations:

- ingest
- validate
- store
- replay
- operate

Guard owns governance admissibility:

- runtime allow or block decisions
- execution-state evaluation
- enforcement traces

## Canonical Artifacts

`governance_impact_preview.v1`

Derives a deterministic preview from `authority_contract.v1`, including governance summary, enforcement behavior, operational consequences, lifecycle implications, and example governed outcomes.

`authority_diff_impact.v1`

Derives semantic impact from old and new authority contracts, including changed governance rules, operational implications, escalation impact, lifecycle continuity implications, and replay continuity implications.

`governance_review_packet.v1`

Builds a review-ready packet from authority, preview, optional diff impact, optional execution evidence, and optional review metadata. It binds immutable input hashes and explicit non-goals.

`authority_bundle.v1`

Builds the publishable governance object from authority contract, publication manifest, preview, optional diff impact, optional review packets, lineage, provenance, schema compatibility, and immutable inputs.

## Deterministic Guarantees

Semantic artifacts are stable for identical structured inputs.

They are derived only from supplied artifact fields. They must not:

- call Guard
- call Cloud
- perform runtime admissibility evaluation
- mutate evidence
- alter replay
- change execution outcomes
- infer unsupported governance meaning

## CLI Examples

```powershell
governance-ledger preview `
  contracts/finance-policy-0.1.0.contract.json `
  --output generated/finance-policy.preview.json

governance-ledger diff-impact `
  --old contracts/finance-policy-0.1.0.contract.json `
  --new contracts/finance-policy-0.2.0.contract.json `
  --output generated/finance-policy.diff-impact.json

governance-ledger review-packet `
  --authority contracts/finance-policy-0.1.0.contract.json `
  --preview generated/finance-policy.preview.json `
  --output generated/finance-policy.review-packet.json

governance-ledger authority-bundle `
  --authority contracts/finance-policy-0.1.0.contract.json `
  --manifest contracts/finance_policy.publication_manifest.json `
  --preview generated/finance-policy.preview.json `
  --output generated/finance-policy.authority-bundle.json
```

## Publishable Governance Object

`authority_bundle.v1` is the publishable governance object.

It lets downstream systems ingest a single canonical bundle instead of reconstructing governance context from separate files. The bundle includes authority identity, contract hash, manifest provenance, semantic artifacts, optional review packets, lineage, schema compatibility, and immutable input hashes.
