# Governance-Ledger Non-Goals

Governance-Ledger is deterministic governance lineage infrastructure. It is not a legal, semantic, or runtime authority.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Governance-Ledger does not:

- Perform legal interpretation.
- Autonomously infer governance truth.
- Replace human governance ownership.
- Evaluate runtime admissibility.
- Execute mutations.
- Decide whether a real-world action is compliant.
- Replace CRI-CORE contract compilation semantics.
- Replace Waveframe Guard runtime enforcement behavior.

## Boundary Principle

Governance-Ledger records and evolves governance state. It does not create hidden meaning.

Unsupported governance language becomes a warning. Ambiguous governance language becomes a warning. Extraction gaps become warnings.

That boundary protects auditability: humans can see what was extracted, what was not extracted, and what requires governance ownership.
