# Governance Event Model

Ledger events are deterministic governance facts.

They explain what changed, what caused it, what projections may be regenerated or invalidated, and what continuity or replay posture must be reinterpreted.

Events are not runtime execution decisions. Guard owns admissibility. Cloud may store and operate event-derived artifacts, but Ledger owns governance event meaning.

## Core Rule

Events are append-only.

Rendering, viewing, filtering, or opening artifacts must not create events. Only explicit governance transitions or deterministic generation steps create events.

## Canonical Event Categories

Ledger uses the following event categories:

- `lifecycle`: authority lifecycle transitions such as drafted, reviewed, exported, registered, superseded, and revoked.
- `continuity`: continuity posture changes that affect resumed, delayed, replayed, or lineage-dependent execution.
- `reconciliation`: deterministic reconciliation findings across lifecycle, lineage, replay, continuity, freshness, active authority, and registry health.
- `projection`: projection generation and invalidation.
- `replay`: replay receipt, replay compatibility, semantic hash, manifest, or lineage evidence posture changes.
- `lineage`: authority version chain, supersession, revocation, and lineage gap events.
- `drift`: deterministic semantic changes across authority versions.
- `registry`: local registry insertion, update, supersession, revocation, and registry coherence posture changes.
- `workspace`: draft state, impact review posture, export readiness, and local workflow invalidation.

## Base Event Envelope

All canonical governance events should conform to `governance_event.v1` or be embeddable in it.

Required fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "governance_event.v1",
  "event_id": "...",
  "event_type": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "authority_ref": "...",
  "authority_version": "...",
  "severity": "info",
  "caused_by_event_id": null,
  "event_category": "lifecycle",
  "immutability_posture": "append_only"
}
```

## Causality Semantics

`caused_by_event_id` links one event to a prior governance event.

Examples:

```text
draft_modified
  -> projection_invalidated

authority_superseded
  -> continuity_posture_changed

bundle_exported
  -> projection_generated
  -> receipt_available

receipt_missing
  -> replay_posture_inconsistent
```

Causality is not ownership. A projection generation event may be caused by a lifecycle event without mutating that lifecycle event.

## Event Immutability

Events must be append-only.

An event may be:

- superseded by a later event
- reconciled by a later event
- invalidated as a source for current projections
- referenced as historical evidence

An event must not be rewritten to match later state.

## Event Lineage

Event lineage is the causal and chronological chain of governance events attached to an authority or authority family.

Lineage answers:

- what happened
- when it happened
- what caused it
- what projections were generated or invalidated
- what continuity or replay posture changed afterward

## Event Replay Semantics

Governance event replay reconstructs semantic governance state from append-only events.

Replay should be able to answer:

- which authority version was active
- which receipt was present
- which projections were fresh, stale, or invalidated
- which continuity posture applied
- which reconciliation issues existed

Replay semantics must not call Guard and must not evaluate runtime admissibility.

## Projection Generation Triggers

Projection generation events record deterministic projection generation.

Canonical schema:

- `projection_generation_event.v1`

Generated projections should record:

- projection name
- generation timestamp
- source event IDs
- freshness posture
- projection version
- projection dependencies

Common triggers:

- impact reviewed
- bundle exported
- authority registered
- authority superseded
- authority revoked
- diagnostics refreshed
- registry state loaded
- lineage recalculated

## Invalidation Propagation Triggers

Projection invalidation events record that a projection is no longer current for the active governance state.

Canonical schema:

- `projection_invalidation_event.v1`

Common triggers:

- draft modified
- authority superseded
- authority revoked
- replay posture invalidated
- diagnostics stale
- lineage changed
- registry event appended

Invalidation must not delete historical projections. It only changes their current operational posture.

## Operational Continuity Triggers

Continuity transition events record changes in governance continuity posture.

Canonical schema:

- `continuity_transition_event.v1`

Common triggers:

- continuity posture changed
- authority superseded
- authority revoked
- multiple active authorities detected
- replay receipt missing
- semantic hash incompatibility detected
- lineage gap detected

## Canonical Event Schemas

### governance_event.v1

Base canonical event envelope for governance facts.

### projection_generation_event.v1

Projection generation event for deterministic projection creation or refresh.

### projection_invalidation_event.v1

Projection invalidation event for stale or invalidated projection posture.

### continuity_transition_event.v1

Continuity transition event for changes in continuity, replay, or active authority coherence posture.

### authority_lifecycle_event.v1

Existing lifecycle event schema for authority lifecycle transitions. It is a specialized lifecycle event and should remain append-only.

## Mutation Boundaries

Events must honor Ledger mutation boundaries:

- viewing is not a lifecycle transition
- rendering is not approval
- preview is not review
- export is not registration
- registration is not admissibility
- diagnostics are advisory

## Non-Goals

Governance events must not:

- call Cloud
- invoke Guard
- perform runtime admissibility evaluation
- overwrite existing events
- generate AI recommendations
- probabilistically score risk
- mutate lifecycle state during rendering

Governance events are deterministic semantic facts. Projections interpret them. UI renders them.
